Limitations and scope notes

- No internal telemetry: This case study relies on qualitative evidence from the GitHub discussion thread. Any numeric estimates are assumptions and must be validated by engineering/analytics.
- No production code: The repository intentionally excludes runtime code, backend changes, and stress test harnesses — those are engineering responsibilities outside this deliverable's scope.
- Platform anomaly: Mentions of specific Android versions in the thread may be inconsistent; treat those as anomalies and call them out for engineering validation.
- UX fidelity: Wireframes are low-fidelity and intended to communicate behavior and states rather than visual polish.

These limitations are deliberate to keep the deliverable focused, verifiable, and suitable for a PM Intern submission with limited time and no internal access.

Privacy and retention note
- Persisted drafts can contain user-generated text. Define a minimal retention policy (suggested: 14 days) and avoid retaining drafts longer than necessary. Confirm whether drafts require encryption-at-rest for enterprise accounts; if so, coordinate with security and engineering.
